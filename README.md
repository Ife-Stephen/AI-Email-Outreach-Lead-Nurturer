## Case Study: AI Social Media Post Creator

### The Problem
Marketing teams often spend hours creating content for multiple social media platforms. Every platform has different best practices, posting schedules, and tone requirements. Manual creation is repetitive, time-consuming, and often inconsistent.

- Generates posts tailored to the selected platform.  
- Suggests captions, hashtags, and posting times.  
- Maintains conversation history for consistent brand voice.  
- Provides an interactive Streamlit interface for easy content generation.

- Ensure consistent tone and messaging across platforms.  
- Saves 60â€“80% of the time marketers previously spent on routine content tasks.
